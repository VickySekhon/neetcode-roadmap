def car_fleet_problem(target, position, speed):
     """
     Calculates the number of car fleets that can reach the target destination.

     Args:
          cars (List[int]): List of positions of cars on a road.
          target (int): Target position on the road.

     Returns:
          int: Number of car fleets that can reach the target.

     Raises:
          ValueError: If the length of the cars list is not equal to the length of the target list.

     Example:
          >>> car_fleet_problem([4,1,0,7], 10, [2,2,1,1])
